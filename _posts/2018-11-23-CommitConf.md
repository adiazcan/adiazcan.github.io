[Commit Conf](https://2018.commit-conf.com/) is a conference where you can view all the perspective to develop software. Two days with more than 150 sessions and more than 2000 attendees with one objective, share knowledge. 

We did a session with my friend [Diego Zapico](https://twitter.com/dzapic0) about how to extend and develop for the most popular asistants like Alexa and Google. 

You can see the session on the conference YouTube Channel.
