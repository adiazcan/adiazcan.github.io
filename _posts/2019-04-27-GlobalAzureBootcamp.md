Global Azure Bootcamp is a community initiative to organize a deep dive day on Azure in the same day around the world. In Madrid, we did our sixth consecutive bootcamp with more than 300 peoples learning Azure.

In addition on organizing it, I did a session about how and when use a Graph database and the features of the Gremlin API of Azure Cosmos DB. I did this session with a former intern at ENCAMINA, [Juan Carlos Mart√≠nes](https://twitter.com/jcmartinezg23), with a great potential in our profession.
