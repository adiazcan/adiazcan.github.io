Starting the year with a meetup at TenerifeDev, my first technical community in my Home at Canary Islands. Taking adventage that Carlos Mendible and me were on holidays on the island, we did a technical session to talk about how Microservices are changing the way we develop and run our applications. 

The agenda was:

- Introduction to Microservices by me
