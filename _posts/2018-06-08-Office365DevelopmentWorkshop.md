As a preview of SharePoint Saturday in Madrid, we did a development workshop about Office 365.

We did a session with my friend and colleague Gustavo Velez, talking about how to use all the power of Azure cloud to develop Office 365 solutions. We did a review of the most importants services from Azure, showing a example of how to use it with Office 365. 

All the labs are inside [CompartiMOSS GitHub repository](https://github.com/CompartiMOSS/SPS-Office-365-Saturday-Madrid-2018-WorkShop)
