DotNet Assistants was my session. With my friend and colleague, Santiago Porras, we talked about how to develop with dotnet core to build an Alexa and Google assistant. In addition to show how to create a API using dotnet core, we talk about how to use the same NLP (Natural Processing Language) for both assistants.
